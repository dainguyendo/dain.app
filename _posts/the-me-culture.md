Characteristics of self-love, confidence, and identity. Great things to have, isn't it? How could these values ever be wronged?

These days, I feel this message is often misconstrued.

Day by day we grow more interconnected. And yet, in concert, these misterpreted messages has strayed further away - creating alienation. An invisible wall placed perfectly in between people.

Social media has shaped channels for free flowing information. These channels operate without pause and at a monstrous scale. The attraction lies within its access and reach. The playing field is seemingly leveled where the common currency is _followers_, _views_, and _likes_.

### We all need to make a living, right?

Analogous to currency, we develop this self-constructed need to _post_ and _share_ to make this living⁺.

And today, people are not persons - they are brands⁺⁺. As a brand, this justifies the rationale. If it is all economics and marketing, what else would there be a need talk about? **The only thing we share is ourselves**.

What does this come to be? To describe, I have nicknamed this as a **Me Culture**. A shift from a culture that associates of an _us_ to a point of _who I am_.

### A forgettable history

In a so-called Me Culture, I would assume there would a great sense of individuality. Ironically enough, I also think of it as a paradox. The homogenous experience of Me that people go through. Each experience all the same - all about me.

Now try to describe this uniform, or rather "_same same but different_" history. Does it picture itself less pronounced? The lack of details makes it forgetful.

> Two is better than one. But what is the importance if the two did not care for each other, isolated? Zero. Zero importance.

With all that said, there is still a place for these things in our universe.

### Closing thoughts

> Let us be mindful.

> Let us not lose ourselves.

> Let us be conscious of you, of me, of we.

⁺For what it's worth, I find this terribly unfortunate and unhealthy.

⁺⁺*Multiple self-brands*, how? The self is a single package right? Interesting.
