My breaking philosophy for the longest has revolved around the **discovery and discipline of the self**. Striving for creativity, this is a **practiced form for most**. The trial and error process is built upon supporting pillars such as originality and progression.

> # "Create flow, break flow."

Albeit cheesy for a break mantra, the phrase has been a tool I find myself coming back to while seeking creavity. Intentionally vague, the phrase leaves an open ended verse to be applied in any way I see fit to my dance. Interpretations are endless - some versions live and mutate, others are premature and later revisited.

Implementations of the mantra has lead to versions of my craft in the long term, in an instance, down to a single movement. The more I reflect on this, the more I see the effects.

Seeking intreptation of the mantra is analogous to a **journey down a river**. Starting from the source, river streams begin to branch off from one another creating what resembles a tree diagram. The choices made along the way shapes a unique interpretation of the experience of the river.

### _Over, and over, different paths down the same river results in equally as different experiences._

Abstracted enough, any process for creativity becomes an isomorphic function. Originally for dance, the process is easily ported to other practices that ask the same demand. This mantra is my method for creativity.
